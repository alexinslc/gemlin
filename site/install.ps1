# Install Gemlin, a tiny AI creature that lives on your desktop: https://gemlin.dev

#
# What this does, step by step:
#   1. Gets uv (https://docs.astral.sh/uv), a tool that installs Python apps, if you don't have it.
#   2. Uses uv to install Gemlin with its own copy of Python, so nothing else on your computer changes.
#   3. Makes the `gemlin` command work in new terminals.
#   4. Wakes Gemlin up, and asks whether it should wake up whenever you log in.
# Run it again any time to update Gemlin. To remove it: gemlin autostart off; uv tool uninstall gemlin
