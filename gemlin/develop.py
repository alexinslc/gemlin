"""`gemlin develop`: teach Gemlin something new, with Gemma doing the typing.

Describe the skill you want. Gemma writes it, Gemlin checks it against the skill rules,
and you can try it, ask for changes in plain words, and save it when it's right. Saved
skills go in ~/.gemlin/skills, like any skill you write yourself.

The same rules and checks are used when Gemlin writes a skill during a chat (learn_skill
or /develop), so a skill is held to the same standard however it was made.

RULES = """A Gemlin skill is ONE Python file with ONE main function. Rules:
- The function name is snake_case and says what it does. Arguments are optional, with
  simple types (int, str, bool) and defaults, so Gemlin can call it with no arguments.
- Its docstring says what it returns, and ends with "Use this when the user asks ..."
  so Gemlin knows when to call it.
- It returns a small dict or list (under about 40 items) that reads well as JSON.
- It only LOOKS. It never deletes, moves, renames or writes files, never changes
  settings, and never reads what's inside the user's files. Names, sizes, dates and
  system information are fine.
- Imports: the Python standard library and psutil only. It should work on macOS,
  Windows and Linux; where something isn't supported, return a dict that says so.
- It handles problems (a missing folder, no permission) by skipping them or returning a
  short message, never by crashing.
- It's short and readable: someone new to Python should be able to follow it."""
